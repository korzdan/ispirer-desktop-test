# ispirer-desktop-test-tasks
A desktop version of application.
This is a Maven `JavaFX` project. `src/main/java/first` contains the class 
that can count created instances. It's the **first** part of the test task.

`src/main/java/second` contains 2 classes - Test and List. List is my custom realization of ArrayList from java.util and
Test is just a class for testing List. That is the **second** part of the test task.

There are 2 classes in `src/main/java` - GreetingGUI and GreetingController. It's the **third** part of the test task.
